# Puzzle Loading Fix

## Issue Fixed

We identified and resolved an issue with puzzles 16, 17, and 18 not loading correctly in the game view. The problem was that these puzzles lacked the `cellNumbers` property that the game view expected.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Game View (game.ejs):**
   - Added a fallback for missing `cellNumbers` property: `puzzle.cellNumbers || {}`
   - Added a null check before accessing `cellNumbers[index]`

2. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - The game now handles puzzles both with and without the `cellNumbers` property
   - No database migration was required, as we made the code resilient to missing properties

## Code Changes

1. When calling `generateGrid`:
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   generateGrid(puzzle.grid, puzzle.cellNumbers);
   
   // After:
   generateGrid(puzzle.grid, puzzle.cellNumbers || {});
   ```

2. In the `generateGrid` function:
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   if (cellNumbers[index]) {
       const numberElement = document.createElement('span');
       numberElement.classList.add('cell-number');
       numberElement.textContent = cellNumbers[index];
       cellElement.appendChild(numberElement);
   }
   
   // After:
   if (cellNumbers && cellNumbers[index]) {
       const numberElement = document.createElement('span');
       numberElement.classList.add('cell-number');
       numberElement.textContent = cellNumbers[index];
       cellElement.appendChild(numberElement);
   }
   ```

## Testing

We created a test script to verify that puzzles with different structures load correctly:
1. Puzzles with the `cellNumbers` property (original format)
2. Puzzles without the `cellNumbers` property (newer format)

The tests confirmed that all puzzles now load correctly in the game view.

## Next Steps

For future puzzle creation, it would be beneficial to standardize the puzzle data format to include consistent properties:
- `grid`: Array of cells
- `clues`: Object with `across` and `down` arrays
- `cellNumbers`: Object mapping cell indices to their numbers

This will ensure consistency across all puzzles and prevent similar issues in the future.
