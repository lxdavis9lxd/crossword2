# Crossword Game Improvements

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Saved Games Not Showing on Dashboard

**Problem:**
Saved games were not appearing on the dashboard due to a double serialization issue with the game progress data.

**Solution:**
- Fixed the way progress data is saved and retrieved
- Updated the server-side code to properly handle progress data that might be already serialized
- Improved client-side data structure for better serialization
- Added validation to ensure data is properly structured

**Key Files Changed:**
- `/workspaces/crossword2/routes/game.js` - Updated progress data handling
- `/workspaces/crossword2/public/scripts.js` - Modified to handle progress data correctly

### 2. Themed Puzzle Titles and Descriptions

**Status:**
- All puzzles now have theme-appropriate titles and descriptions
- Frontend displays these titles and descriptions on the puzzle cards
- Saved games list shows puzzle titles instead of just IDs
- This makes the gaming experience more immersive and user-friendly

**Testing:**
- Created comprehensive test scripts to verify functionality
- Manually verified that all puzzle titles and descriptions are displayed correctly
- Confirmed that saved games show the proper puzzle titles
