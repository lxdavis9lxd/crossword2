# Crossword Game Improvements

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Saved Games Not Showing on Dashboard

**Problem:**
Saved games were not appearing on the dashboard due to a double serialization issue with the game progress data.

**Solution:**
- Fixed the way progress data is saved and retrieved
- Updated the server-side code to properly handle progress data that might be already serialized
- Improved client-side data structure for better serialization
- Added validation to ensure data is properly structured

**Key Files Changed:**
- `/workspaces/crossword2/routes/game.js` - Updated progress data handling
- `/workspaces/crossword2/public/scripts.js` - Modified to handle progress data correctly

### 2. Themed Puzzle Titles and Descriptions

**Problem:**
Puzzle theme names and descriptions were not showing up properly on the dashboard and game pages.

**Solution:**
- All puzzles now have theme-appropriate titles and descriptions
- Updated the dashboard display to properly show titles and descriptions
- Enhanced the game page to prominently display the puzzle title and description
- Improved the saved games list to show puzzle titles instead of just IDs

**Key Files Changed:**
- `/workspaces/crossword2/views/game.ejs` - Updated to display title and description
- `/workspaces/crossword2/public/styles.css` - Added styling for puzzle information
- `/workspaces/crossword2/public/scripts.js` - Enhanced to properly show themed puzzles

**Testing:**
- Created comprehensive test scripts to verify functionality
- Manually verified that all puzzle titles and descriptions are displayed correctly
- Confirmed that saved games show the proper puzzle titles
