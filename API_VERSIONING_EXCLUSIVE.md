# API Versioning Implementation Summary

## Overview

The crossword application has been updated to exclusively use API versioning with a `/v1` prefix for all routes. This change provides a more structured API and enables future versioning capabilities while maintaining a consistent approach throughout the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side Routing
- Modified `app.js` to mount all routes with the `/v1` prefix
- Updated route handlers to use versioned paths
- Redirected base endpoints to their versioned counterparts

### 2. View Templates
- Updated all form actions to point to versioned API endpoints
- Modified navigation links to use versioned routes
- Ensured consistent versioning across all templates

### 3. Testing Scripts
- Updated `test_excel_upload.sh` to use versioned API endpoints
- Ensured all API requests include the `/v1` prefix

### 4. Documentation
- Added versioning information to README.md
- Created comprehensive documentation explaining the versioning approach

## Benefits

1. **Structured API**: All endpoints follow a consistent pattern with the `/v1` prefix
2. **Future-Proofing**: Enables the introduction of new API versions without breaking existing functionality
3. **Better Organization**: Clearly separates API versions and enables proper versioning management
4. **Consistent Experience**: All parts of the application use the same versioning approach

## Testing

All application functionality has been tested with the versioned API endpoints:
- Authentication works correctly with `/v1/auth/*` routes
- Admin functionality operates properly via `/v1/admin/*` routes
- Game features function as expected through `/v1/game/*` endpoints

## Notes for Developers

When working with this application, remember:
1. Always use the `/v1` prefix for all routes
2. All form submissions must target versioned endpoints
3. All API requests must include the version prefix
4. Link generation in templates should include the version prefix
