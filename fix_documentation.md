# Crossword Game Progress Fix

## Issue
Saved games were not showing up on the dashboard due to inconsistent handling of progress data between serialization and deserialization.

## Root Cause
- The client was sending progress data as a JSON string
- The server was storing this as a string within another string (double serialization)
- When retrieving the data, it couldn't be properly deserialized

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Game Progress Saving (routes/game.js)
- Improved how progress data is processed before saving to the database
- Added proper parsing of JSON strings to avoid double serialization
- Added validation to make sure progress data is correctly formatted

### 2. Improved Progress Data Structure (public/scripts.js)
- Changed grid state from an array to an object for better serialization/deserialization
- Added a timestamp to track when games were last played

### 3. Fixed Progress Retrieval (routes/game.js)
- Added better error handling when retrieving saved games
- Ensured consistent data format between saving and loading

### 4. Improved Progress Loading in Game (views/game.ejs)
- Added validation to ensure progress data is in the correct format before applying it
- Added handling for metadata fields like lastPlayed

## Testing
A comprehensive test script was created to validate that:
1. Users can save their game progress
2. Saved games appear correctly on the dashboard
3. Users can select and resume a saved game

The test script was run successfully, confirming that all game progress functionality is now working as expected.

## Conclusion
The issue with saved games not appearing on the dashboard has been resolved. The application now correctly handles saving and loading game progress, and users can see and resume their saved games from the dashboard.
