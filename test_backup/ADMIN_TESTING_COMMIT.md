# Admin Feature Testing Improvements

This commit adds comprehensive testing for admin features and access control:

1. Fixed login functionality in auth.js by correctly importing and using Sequelize Op operator
2. Added comprehensive admin feature testing that verifies:
   - Admin login works correctly
   - Admin dashboard is accessible
   - User management features work
   - Puzzle management features work
   - Import functionality works
   - Template download works

3. Added admin access control testing to verify:
   - Users with admin role can access admin pages
   - Regular users are properly denied access to admin pages (403 Forbidden)

All tests are now passing, confirming that admin features are working correctly and access control is properly implemented.
