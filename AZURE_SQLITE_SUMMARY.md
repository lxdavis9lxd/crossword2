# Azure Deployment Summary for Crossword App with SQLite

## What's Been Done

1. **SQLite Configuration**
   - Modified database config to use SQLite in all environments (dev, test, prod)
   - Set up configurable database path via environment variable `SQLITE_PATH`
   - Created a persistent data directory strategy for Azure

2. **Session Management**
   - Configured fallback options for session storage (in-memory, Redis, Azure Tables)
   - Added appropriate dependency handling

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Created `.env.example` with SQLite-specific configurations
   - Added dotenv support in the application

4. **API Path Fixes**
   - Confirmed `/v1/game/puzzles/${level}` path is correctly used in the frontend
   - Improved path handling for Azure hosting

5. **Deployment Scripts**
   - Created `deploy.sh` to handle SQLite persistent storage setup
   - Created `prepare_for_azure.sh` to prepare the application for deployment
   - Added `.deployment` file for Azure deployment instructions

6. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed `AZURE_SQLITE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` guide

## Ready-to-Use Files

The following files have been prepared and are ready for use:

- `/workspaces/crossword2/config/database.js` - SQLite database configuration
- `/workspaces/crossword2/models/index.js.new` - Updated models configuration for SQLite
- `/workspaces/crossword2/app.js.azure` - Azure-optimized application file
- `/workspaces/crossword2/package.json.new` - Updated dependencies
- `/workspaces/crossword2/deploy.sh` - Azure deployment helper script
- `/workspaces/crossword2/.env.example` - Example environment variables

## Next Steps to Deploy

1. **Run the preparation script**
   ```bash
   ./prepare_for_azure.sh
   ```
   This will set up all necessary files for deployment.

2. **Create Azure App Service**
   - Create an App Service in the Azure Portal or using Azure CLI
   - Set up deployment using Git, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps

3. **Configure App Settings in Azure**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_random_string
   SQLITE_PATH=/home/site/wwwroot/data/database.sqlite
   ```

4. **Deploy Your Application**
   - Push your code to the deployment source
   - Verify that `deploy.sh` runs during deployment

5. **Monitor and Test**
   - Check the logs for any issues
   - Test all functionality, especially puzzle loading

## Benefits of SQLite on Azure

- **Simplicity**: No need for separate database service
- **Cost-effective**: No additional database costs
- **Familiar**: Continue using the same database system
- **Performance**: Good for moderate traffic applications

Using this implementation, your Crossword application will run efficiently on Azure App Service while maintaining SQLite as the database backend.
