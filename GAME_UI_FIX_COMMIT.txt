Fixed game features CSS modernization by:

1. Added proper static file serving for /v1/ prefix to ensure CSS files are correctly accessible
2. Updated app.js and app_v1.js to include static middleware for /v1/ prefix routes
3. Made sure game-styles-modern.css is properly applied to game views
4. Confirmed all game UI elements have appropriate modern styling

This change ensures that the game features now have consistent styling aligned with the admin interface, but with a distinct green color scheme, providing a cohesive user experience across the application.
