# Button Theme Display - Manual Verification Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the steps to manually verify that the "Start Game" button on the dashboard properly displays the selected puzzle's theme.

## Verification Steps

### Dashboard Button Verification

1. **Access the Dashboard**
   - Log in to the application
   - Navigate to the dashboard page

2. **Initial State Check**
   - The "Start Game" button should be disabled
   - Button text should read "Start Game"
   - Button should have a light gray background

3. **Load Puzzles**
   - Select a difficulty level (Easy, Intermediate, or Advanced)
   - Click "Load Puzzles" button
   - Verify puzzles appear with themed titles and descriptions
   - Button should still be disabled and show "Start Game"

4. **Select a Puzzle**
   - Click on any puzzle card
   - ✅ VERIFY: The button should update to show "Play 'Puzzle Theme Name'"
   - ✅ VERIFY: The button should become enabled
   - ✅ VERIFY: The button should change appearance (slightly darker green, subtle lift effect)

5. **Change Selection**
   - Click on a different puzzle card
   - ✅ VERIFY: The button should update to show the new theme
   - Button should remain enabled with the enhanced style

6. **Reset Check**
   - Select a different difficulty level
   - ✅ VERIFY: The button should reset to "Start Game"
   - ✅ VERIFY: The button should be disabled again
   - ✅ VERIFY: The button should return to its default style

7. **End-to-End Flow**
   - Select a puzzle
   - Click the button to start the game
   - ✅ VERIFY: The game page should load with the same theme in its title

## Code Verification

The key changes that implement this feature are:

1. **In `scripts.js`**: 
   ```javascript
   // When selecting a puzzle card
   startGameBtn.textContent = `Play "${title}"`;
   
   // When resetting (loading puzzles)
   startGameBtn.textContent = 'Start Game';
   ```

2. **In `styles.css`**:
   ```css
   #start-game-btn:not([disabled]) {
     background-color: #388e3c;
     box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
     transform: translateY(-1px);
   }
   ```

## Additional Testing Resources

For visual testing, run:
```
node visual_button_theme_check.js
```

This will start a test server at http://localhost:3001 that allows you to:
- See the initial button state
- Test selecting different puzzles to see the button text update
- Test the reset functionality
- View the test results in a visual interface

## Expected Result

When a user selects a puzzle from the grid, the "Start Game" button should update to:
1. Show "Play 'Puzzle Theme Name'" (with the actual theme name)
2. Become enabled (clickable)
3. Have a slightly enhanced visual appearance

This provides immediate feedback about which puzzle is selected and creates a more engaging user experience.
