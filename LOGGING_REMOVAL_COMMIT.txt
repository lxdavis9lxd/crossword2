Remove client-side logging to cPanel Passenger logs

- Modified errorlogger.js to remove server-side logging functionality
- Updated the fallback logToServer function to only log to browser console
- Disabled the API endpoint in routes/api.js that was writing logs to server
- Maintained the same function interfaces to avoid breaking existing code

These changes should prevent client-side logs from being sent to the server
and appearing in the cPanel Passenger log files.
