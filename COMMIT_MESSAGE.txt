Fix Import-Puzzles Functionality and Admin.js Corruption

This commit resolves two critical issues:

1. Fixed the "Cannot GET /admin/import-puzzles" error by replacing the corrupted admin.js file
2. Fixed puzzles 16, 17, and 18 not loading correctly by adding cellNumbers fallback

## Fixes Implemented

- Backed up the corrupted admin.js file as admin.js.broken
- Restored admin.js with proper route handlers for import-puzzles
- Fixed the puzzleFile/excelFile name mismatch in the import route handler
- Added fallback for missing cellNumbers property in game.ejs
- Created extensive test scripts to verify both fixes
- Updated documentation with detailed explanations of the fixes

These changes ensure:
1. The admin import-puzzles interface is now accessible
2. Excel files can be successfully uploaded and imported
3. All puzzles (including #16, #17, and #18) now load correctly

These changes ensure a consistent puzzle data structure while maintaining compatibility with existing puzzles in the database.

## Testing

Test cases have been created to verify the fixes:
- Created test puzzles in both formats to verify compatibility
- Validated that both puzzle types display correctly in admin views
- Verified that newly created puzzles can be properly displayed and played

Detailed documentation has been added in PUZZLE_CREATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md with implementation details and future recommendations.
