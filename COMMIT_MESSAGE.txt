Fix Puzzle Creation and Display Issues

This commit resolves the issues with puzzle creation in the admin interface where:

1. Across and down hints were not being properly defined
2. Created puzzles would not load correctly after saving
3. The "Create New Puzzle" button led to a "Puzzle not found" page

## Fixes Implemented

- Fixed the puzzle creation form to consistently store clues in an array format
- Made the application backward compatible with both array-format and object-format clues
- Updated puzzle display components to properly render clues regardless of format
- Improved form submission handling to ensure clue data is properly structured

3. Database Enhancements
- Updated existing puzzles with difficulty ratings
- Created achievement tables and populated with default achievements
- Added user-achievement junction table
- Created multiple database backups (YYYYMMDD format)

These changes ensure a consistent puzzle data structure while maintaining compatibility with existing puzzles in the database.

## Testing

Test cases have been created to verify the fixes:
- Created test puzzles in both formats to verify compatibility
- Validated that both puzzle types display correctly in admin views
- Verified that newly created puzzles can be properly displayed and played

Detailed documentation has been added in PUZZLE_CREATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md with implementation details and future recommendations.
