# Test Files Cleanup

This document describes the cleanup of test files from the Crossword2 application.

## Cleanup Summary

On May 22, 2025, approximately 88 test files were removed from the application's workspace. These files were used during development and testing but were not essential to the production application.

## Backup Created

All removed files were backed up in the `/workspaces/crossword2/test_backup/` directory. If any of these files need to be restored for future development or debugging, they can be found in this location.

## Changes to package.json

The package.json file was updated to remove test scripts that referenced the removed files. Only the "start" script was retained.

## Files Removed

The removed files included:
- Unit and integration test scripts (*.js)
- Test documentation files (*.md)
- Debug scripts
- Verification scripts
- Test shell scripts
- Test data files

## Reason for Cleanup

The removal of these test files was performed to clean up the workspace and ensure that only essential application files are maintained in the production codebase.
