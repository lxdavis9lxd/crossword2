This commit includes:

1. Verification of Puzzle Theme Display
- Confirmed all puzzles correctly display themed names instead of generic identifiers
- Verified descriptions are properly shown for all puzzles
- Added test scripts to verify themes are correctly implemented

2. Testing Tools Added
- Created dashboard_theme_tester.js for visual verification of puzzle themes
- Added test_puzzle_themes.js and test_puzzle_themes_api.js for automated testing
