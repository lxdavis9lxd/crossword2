# API Versioning Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Created API Testing Script with `/v1` Prefix**
   - Updated `/workspaces/crossword2/test_excel_upload_v1.sh` to use the `/v1` prefix for all endpoints
   - Made the script executable with `chmod +x`
   - Added additional debugging output to help identify potential issues

2. **Created Versioned Application File**
   - Created `/workspaces/crossword2/app_v1.js` which duplicates all routes with the `/v1` prefix
   - Added versioned routes for authentication, game, achievements, and admin functionality
   - Maintained backward compatibility by keeping original routes

3. **Created Application Runner**
   - Created `/workspaces/crossword2/run_app_v1.sh` to easily start the application with API versioning support
   - Made the script executable with `chmod +x`

4. **Documentation**
   - Created `/workspaces/crossword2/API_VERSIONING.md` with detailed information about the API versioning approach
   - Documented the route structure, testing methodology, and future considerations

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the versioned application:
   ```
   ./run_app_v1.sh
   ```

2. Run the API version testing script:
   ```
   ./test_excel_upload_v1.sh
   ```

3. Check for successful Excel file upload and processing via the `/v1` prefixed endpoints

## Results

The implementation allows the application to support both original routes and routes with the `/v1` prefix, establishing a foundation for proper API versioning. This approach enables:

- Gradual migration to versioned APIs
- Introduction of breaking changes in future versions without affecting existing clients
- Clear indication of API stability through versioning
- Better API lifecycle management

## Next Steps

- Configure CI/CD to test both original and versioned APIs
- Develop a strategy for introducing `/v2` APIs when needed
- Consider implementing API request/response validation specific to each version
- Create comprehensive API documentation for developers
